# Contributing

We use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/CrociDB/bulletty/issues) to discuss the tasks that need to be done for the project.

## Guidelines

1. Make sure to use `cargo fmt` before comitting anything
2. Write code without compiler warnings
3. On your PR, explain exactly what your code is doing and, even more importantly, why.
4. Write tests for components that are testable (library managing, feed logic, filesystem, etc)
